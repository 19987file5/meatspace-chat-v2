1. All non-trivial\* changes by any author shall be submitted by pull request.
2. Any project owner (as defined by the ability to merge to master) may merge
   any pull request, including their own.

\*In terms of non-trivial, it's hard to define exactly what that is, but
generally you should know it when you see it. E.g. typo fixes, or merge error
fixes, etc. -- things that are 1-2 lines and designed to unbreak.
